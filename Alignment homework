#   I did a nucleotide blast of accession number AF163036 on ncbi wich returned many closely related organisms, I will list them here:
#Xylaria hypoxylon CBS 590.72
#Xylaria polymorpha strain NW-FVA2229
#Xylaria polymorpha strain DSM 105756
#Xylaria polymorpha strain FeC105
#Xylaria polymorpha isolate TW07032019_02
#Xylaria sp. isolate MBD_3013
#Xylaria schweinitzii voucher HMJAU 22751
#Xylaria scruposa isolate 866
#Xylaria longipes strain NW-FVA2228
#Xylaria corniformis

#I then downloaded the unaligned fasta files from each of these species and named the file xylaria_dump.txt.  in the terminal I used the following command to change this file to a fasta file

mv xylaria_dump.txt xylaria_dump.fasta
#Since this file is unaligned I used the following to align the files

mafft --auto xylaria_dump.fasta > xylaria_dump_aligned.fasta

#the alignment worked correctly producing an aligned file, this file can be found in my data folder in the follwoing repository
